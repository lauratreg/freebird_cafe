</div><br /><p>Cafe has a really nice interior! And we were so excitied to try out their food. We ordered vegan pancakes and my sister a gluten free version. It was delicious!! And the Cappuccino I had with it (with home made almond milk) was to die for! Great experience! We were happy to have such a huge selection of vegan food and drinks.<br /> - Trip Advisor Review</p></div>

</div><br /><p>We felt so healthy and refreshed after our delicious meal here, ready to tackle a full day of touring temples. The food is not only healthy, beautiful, and delicious, but local, organic, and often raw. We had the amazing salad sampler where you can choose 3 of their many salad choices. .<br /> - Happy Cow Review</p></div>

</div><br /><p>I came here quite often because I love the uniqueness of the food that you cannot find anywhere else. It's hard to find Burmese food let alone some that are delicious but also nutritiously good for you. They use the best quality for your food and there is also no sugar in any of their food, especially Thai Food. That's rare to find because most of the Thai food in Chiang Mai uses a lot of sugars.<br /> - Kaitlyn</p></div>

</div><br /><p>I popped into Free Bird the other day when the rains had settled in and there was a chill in the air. I ordered the Pumpkin and Ginger curry which was delicious - creamy and full of veggie goodness! Perfect for the (slightly) chilly weather. I also ordered the Dirty Chai which was really tasty. The service was great as usual and there was a calm and friendly atmosphere in there, which meant I stayed longer to sit and read.<br /> -Natalie</p></div>

</div><br /><p>The philosophy behind this cafe and the work they do is amazing. It is easy to forget that Thailand has refugees from nearby countries and that freedom is not always a given for many.The food is amazing. I had a simple salad sandwich and a yummy spritzer drink. There is free wifi and the artwork on the side of the building is worth looking at as well. Food is vegetarian and there are so many options! It took me ages to decide!<br /> -Ngaire</p></div>

</div><br /><p>Free Bird Cafe is where you can get a good taste of Burmese, Shan, or other indigenous foods, like no where else in Chiang Mai. Their vegetarian food has various healthy and hearty options. For Vegetarian is good enough... But if you are a hard core Vegan or other strict diet, you choice is obviously less or limited. Their drinks are various in combination too which makes many fruit smoothies tasty. <br /> -Anne</p></div>
