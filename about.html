<h2><span>History</span></h2>
<p class="tagline">
  short & sweet
</p>
<p>
  The Free Bird Caf√© got it start in 2009 to fill a need for funds for Thai Freedom House. Lisa was finding it difficult to work and an English Teacher, educate and run Thai Freedom House, and find the funds to keep it running. Lisa took the panini maker out of her own house, a donated blender and coffee maker - she started selling toasties, smoothies, and cofees to fund the school. Lisa drew on her previous restaurant experience and her love for a plant based diet, she decided to expand Free Bird Cafe into a vegetarian restaurant
  <br /> <br />
  Today, 8 years later, Free Bird Cafe is a staple of the Chiang Mai community. Free Bird Cafe prides itself in using high quality ingredients, fresh vegetables, and each dish made with love by a dedicated staff member.

  <h2><span>What is a</span> Social Enterprise?</h2>
  <p>Social enterprises are revenue-generating businesses with a twist. Whether operated by a non-profit organization or by a for-profit company, a social enterprise has two goals: to achieve social, cultural, community economic and/or environmental outcomes; and, to earn revenue. On the surface, many social enterprises look, feel, and even operate like traditional businesses. But looking more deeply, one discovers the defining characteristics of the social enterprise: mission is at the centre of business, with income generation playing an important supporting role.
<span class="tagline">- The Center for Community Enterprise</span>
<br />
<p>
  Free Bird Cafe is 100% Social Enterprise. Meaning that every dollar made by the cafe first goes right back into the business. From paying the staff their salaries, the rent and utilities for Free Bird Cafe & Thai Freedom House, to providing supplies for education, to helping build libraries on the Thailand/Burma boarder. The reach of Free Bird Cafe is beyond just the cafe, but truly affects the communities of Northern Thailand.
