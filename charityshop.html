<h5>Construction Sites</h5>
  <p>
    Anything that is not sold in the shop is packed up and sent to IDP camps on the Burma border, refugee camps in Thailand and construction worker camps. In the construction worker camps the workers are forced to live on-site and canâ€™t go anywhere. They get paid way under minimum wage, and while they have nothing they still try to send money home. Entire families live there. Usually they do have electricity, so we can bring them radios and lights. As the houses cannot be properly closed up, and there is standing water everywhere, we take mosquito nets.  </p>
