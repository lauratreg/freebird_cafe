<h4>Objectives</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Collect Donations</li>
    <p>
      We take anything that people wish to give, including towels, toiletries, bedding, clothing for all ages, camping equipment, electronics, household equipment. We get a lot donated by two Chiang Mai orphanages, who cannot do anything with the large amount of donations they receive.
    </p>
    <li>Sort and Store Donations</li>
      <p>
        We keep everything that comes to us, and store it in our upstairs rooms. The only thing we don’t take is underwear! <br />
  Anything that is not appropriate for use in the IDP camps is sold in our Pre-Loved Charity shop. Items of clothing that are too big, too sexy, or things that are better to sell and make money for the projects. We can use the money for things that the people actually need. <br />
  We usually sell electronic items in order to buy new school materials or household equipment for the IDP camps.
      </p>
      <li>Donation Distribution</li>
        <p>
          Anything that is not sold in the shop is packed up and sent to IDP camps on the Burma border, refugee camps in Thailand and construction worker camps. In the construction worker camps the workers are forced to live on-site and can’t go anywhere. They get paid way under minimum wage, and while they have nothing they still try to send money home. Whole families live there. Usually they do have electricity, so we can bring them radios and lights. We take mosquito nets, as the houses cannot be properly closed up, and there is water everywhere.
        We take what is appropriate for each place.  Sometimes we distribute to orphanages and in rural areas inside Burma, with the help of other NGOs

        <li>Pre-loved Charity Shop</li>
          <p>
            Our pre-loved charity shop is 100% non for profit. The stands and hangers were donated, and all it cost was the space. We would like to develop more projects for the shop, and get the Sewing and Handicraft Project involved in creating artistic products to sell.

<h4>Ongoing and Current Needs</h4>
<ul>
<li>We NEED a truck to move donations to the border and into Burma. We can also use it to pick
  people up and bring them to training sessions, and to transport our dance troops to performances.</li>

  <li>The donation centre takes a lot of work, and we NEED a regular volunteer to sort through everything every week, see what can go in the shop and what can be distributed elsewhere. They can also help to restock the shop every week. </li>

  <li>We also NEED someone to develop products for the shop, and to do creative trainings for our students in how to design and create products. Someone who could come in on our weekends would be ideal.</li>
